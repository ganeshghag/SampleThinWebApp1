					The Ghag Family
				</h1>
				<p>
					Welcome to the zoo. There I said it, that is exactly what this family is, a complete zoo and we would not have it any other way too :) The following details are about the population inhabiting Flower Valley. Please do not take us seriously, though we are very serious folks, but the thing about being serious is that it is seriously mistaken to be less serious than it actually is. And that is the reason, we keep away from being labelled serious though we are actually very serious.

				Janhavi Ghag
			</h2>
			<p>
				She is the elder one and very cool and meek on the outside. On the inside though, she is a raging volcano. Especially when it comes to dealing with her kid sister, she becomes a totally different person and a not so pleasant one at that. Anyways, she likes sleeping a lot and just lazying around and goofing off. You have to catch her is a really good mood, to see her do imitations and mimicry. Best of luck with that though.

			<h2>
				Vallari Ghag
			</h2>
			<p>
				She is the youngest one and spoilt like nobody's business. Need I say more. She looks cuter than a strawberry and talks baby talk. She gets a wittle cranky, when she is sleepy and does all kinds of irrational stuff, when in that state.
